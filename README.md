This is the web3 dapp I have always wanted to create. A tool for all things for users have access to protocols on the blockchain. Security tips and tricks that can only be
learned through years of trial and errors will live here forever. Log in with a web3 wallet to upload your security trick/tip. Log in to upvote tips you find usefull to keep them
highlighted( I will only show the top 20 on in the page, you can go to the next pages but I feel like with google page results, many will not). I will forever index these tips on the 
blockchain. They will live forever. Long after im gone they will still be accessible. I may break this into 2 websites, but for right now I feel all the tools and tips should be accessible 
for all on my hosted full stack application.
